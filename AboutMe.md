Hi, I'm a 19 y/o urugayan student.
I'm interested in developing my programming skills
I've been studying and experimenting with Python, html and css for the past few years of my life
but my knowlegde in those languges is still pretty basic
programming is something I've always been interested
I'm pretty excited to become better and learn new things!
